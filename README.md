# reddit api

This thing performs a search using the reddit subreddits API.

### New things in this project

1. sass: nested statements, variables, import files. (todo: try expressions)

### Todo

* case insensitive search
* separate out logic.js
* multiple `not:` pseudo-selectors allowed
* browser-sync
* why isn't gulp-watch working?
